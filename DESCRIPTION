Title: Calculate Whether Net Promoter Score Has Significantly Changed Between 2 Samples

Description: A margin of error is calculated for each sample, from the number of promoters, neutrals (i.e. passives) and detractors. The standard error of their difference is estimated using the Pythagorean formula, and the absolute difference of the two samples is compared to this multiplied by the critical value (aka z*-value).
    The return value is in (-1, 0, +1), according to whether a significant decrease is found, no significant change, or a significant increase, respectively. If the total for a sample is 0, then 0 is returned.
    Formula is based on the one found in this blog post: (https://www.genroe.com/blog/how-to-calculate-margin-of-error-and-other-stats-for-nps/5994).
